# Prodigy Build Testing Vidhi

This is a repository for code related to a variety of data structures and algorithms, primarily in C language. It also includes some projects like tic tac toe and todo list. It also deals with some IntelliJ project setup files.

## Prerequisites:

- An installed version of C compiler for running C code files. For example, GCC.
- Text editor or an IDE like IntelliJ
- An installed Git version control system is also preferred in order to download and update the project easily.

## Setup Steps:

### For Mac:
1. To install gcc use the following commands on your Terminal
  
   `xcode-select --install`
   
   `brew install gcc`
  

2. Installing IntelliJ , you can download it from this link:

   https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac
   

3. Clone the repository

   `git clone [Repo URL]`

4. Run the project:

   `gcc -o outputfile yourfile.c` 

   `./outputfile`

### For Windows:

1. Install mingw-w64 via Scoop:

   Open powershell as administrator and call:

   `scoop install gcc`


2. To install IntelliJ , you can download it from this link:

   https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows.


3. To install Git , you can download it from this link:

   https://git-scm.com/download/win.


4. Clone the repository:

   `git clone [Repo URL]`

5. Run the Project:
   
   `gcc -o outputfile yourfile.c`
   
   `./outputfile`

   
## Environments Setup:

While IntelliJ might be configured automatically, you need to set up GCC and Git manually after installation by adding the install location to your system path.

The project does not rely on specific environments and generally should run on any system with GCC installed and properly configured.

For database tools there doesn't seem to be any DB related code in the files given.

## CI/CD Pipeline:

Regarding the CI/CD pipeline, there are no related files in the given repository. Therefore, no deployment steps are included.

However, you might want to research how to implement a CI/CD pipeline suitable for your development scheme. This could range from a simple script that builds the project on a regular basis to professional solutions like Jenkins or GitHub Actions that enable continuous integration and continuous delivery.

## Dependencies:

There are no specific version dependencies mentioned in this project. The provided C code should generally work on any C compiler. However latest stable versions of all software should be used for best compatibility.

Code files don't seem to have any dependencies on each other, referring to their content.

## Versioning:

No version-specific details are found in the given codebase. Please follow best Semantic Versioning practices during development.

## Contributing:

For how to contribute, refer to each file's CONTRIBUTING.md if provided. Generally, bug reports, fixes, and feature requests are welcome. Please open an issue beforehand to discuss the changes and update tests as appropriate.
