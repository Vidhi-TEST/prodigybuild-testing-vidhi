# prodigybuild-testing-vidhi

This is a repository containing various code snippets and algorithms grouped in various directories. The repository includes algorithms written in C, including searching and sorting algorithms, a binary search tree implementation, and list insert/delete operations. The repository also contains C code for a simple tic-tac-toe game and a todo list.

## Getting Started

To run these projects, you need to have a C compiler installed on your machine. On macOS, this can be done by installing XCode. From versions of macOS Catalina and above, you may need to install Command Line Tools separately from XCode. On Windows, you can install a C compiler such as MinGW.

### Prerequisites

1. Install Xcode on macOS:
    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```
    Verify the installation by running:
    ```bash
    gcc --version
    ```
  
2. Install MinGW on Windows:
    - Go to MinGW's [Download Page](http://www.mingw.org/download/installer).
    - Click on "mingw-get-setup.exe" link to download the MinGW installer.
    - Run the installer.
    - In the installation wizard, select "mingw32-base" for installation and select "Apply Changes" from Installation menu.

### Running the project locally 
  
To run a file, use the gcc command to compile the code and then run the output:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
```

Replace `filename.c` with the name of the file you want to run and `output` with the name you want to give to the compiled output.

## Deployment

Refer to the CI/CD pipeline configured within the repository for steps for deployment. The pipeline can include steps for building, testing, and deploying the project.
