# prodigybuild-testing-vidhi

This repository is for a Prodigious Build test by Vidhi. It contains code related to various algorithms and data structures implemented in C language. The code in this repository builds and runs locally; it is supported on both Windows and macOS.

## Pre-requisites:
- An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like JetBrains is recommended.
- C Compiler is required, like gcc.
- Python Interpreter is recommended for certain scripts.

## Setup Instructions:
- Step 1: Clone the repository
- Step 2: Install required software as per your operating system.

### For Windows:
- Download and Install [MinGW](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php)
- Download and Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) (optional but recommended for running python scripts)

Run the following command in your terminal to set MinGW to your PATH:
```
setx /M PATH "C:\MinGW\bin;%PATH%"
```

### For macOS:
- C Compiler (gcc) comes preinstalled.
- Python comes preinstalled too.


## Starting Locally

Open the `.c` files in your IDE or text editor, build and run the code.

## Deploying


## Environments

This project will run in any environment that supports the C language and Python. It is ideal to have an IDE for code organization and ease of development.

## CI/CD

This project doesn't currently include any CI/CD integrations, but pull requests and code modifications would need to pass all existing tests and have passing tests for any new code.
